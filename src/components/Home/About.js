                    <p id="info4">Hello! My name is Syed Ateeb and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My
                        interest
                        in web development started back in 2021 when I decided to try and make a single page
                        application,
                        which taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
                    </p>

                    <p id="info5">I'm an aspiring developer heavily influenced by storytelling, interactions, and UX.
                        Addicted to music, games, and visual arts. From India, based in Jamshedpur.</p>

                    <p id="info6">I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and thoughtful interactions.
                        I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.</p>
